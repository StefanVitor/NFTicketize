# 2.2.1 (2019-01-20)
- `find()` no longer crashes on ENOENT (e.g. when one of the files has been deleted by other process).
- Added check if a parameter `newName` passed to `rename()` isn't a path.

# 2.2.0 (2018-10-13)
- Added ignoreCase option to `find()` and `copy()` methods.

- From now on the library ships with TypeScript type definitions.

# 2.0.0 (2018-07-10)
- **(breaking change)** removed `symlinks` config option of `find()` method. Now `find()` always follows symlinks.

# 1.3.1 (2018-07-09)
- Fixed bug in `existsAsync()`.

# 1.3.0 (2018-02-09)
- `overwrite` function passed to `copyAsync()` can return promise.

# 1.1.0 (2017-06-18)
- Parameter `overwrite` of `copy()` method now supports functions, to allow you individually decide if each file overwrite should happen.

# 1.0.0 (2017-05-14)
- API declared stable. From now on braking changes will be minimized and whenever possible preceded by deprecation periods.
- Codebase updated to ES6

# 0.13.3 (2017-03-25)

- Added lacking promise rejection handler for `copyAsync()`.

# 0.13.0 (2017-03-15)
- **(breaking change)** Dropped support for node.js 0.10 and 0.12
- **(possibly breaking change)** fs-jetpack no longer uses libraries `mkdirp` and `rimraf`, those have been replaced with in-house implementations doing the same task. The new implementations are simpler than original libraries, so some edge cases might emerge after upgrading (please file an issue if you stumbled upon such case).
- Started using native promises instead of `Q` library

# 0.12.0 (2017-02-19)
- **(breaking change)** Changes in `symlinks` option passed to `inspect()`.
- Added `symlinks` option to `inspectTree()`.

# 0.11.0 (2017-02-09)
- Added input validation for the whole API
- **(breaking change)** Removed already deprecated option `buf` for `read()` method

# 0.10.5 (2016-12-07)
- Fixed `find()` bug when `directories` is set to `true` and only negation glob is used.

# 0.10.4 (2016-12-06)
- Fixed matcher edge cases, improved matcher tests (affects `find()` and `copy()` methods).

# 0.10.3 (2016-11-23)
- Fixed directory tree traversal bug which was causing problems for `findAsync()` and `copyAsync()`.

# 0.10.2 (2016-11-08)
- Fixed `console.log(jetpack)` for node v6.6.0 or newer.

# 0.10.1 (2016-11-01)
- Bugfixed case when `copyAsync()` was leaving open read stream if write stream errored.
- Tests ported from jasmine to mocha.

# 0.10.0 (2016-10-17)
- `copyAsync()` uses only streams (much more memory efficient).
- `find()` supports `recursive` option.

# 0.9.2 (2016-06-27)
- Updated third party dependencies to quell minimatch intallation warnings.

# 0.9.1 (2016-05-21)
- Bug-fixed `jetpack.read('nonexistent_file', 'json')`.

# 0.9.0 (2016-05-10)
- **(breaking change)** `read()`, `list()`, `inspect()` and `inspectTree()` returns `undefined` instead of `null` if path doesn't exist.
- More sane edge cases for `dir()`, `file()` and `list()`.

# 0.8.0 (2016-04-09)
- **(breaking change)** `find()` now distinguishes between files and directories and by default searches only for files (previously searched for both).
- **(breaking change)** `find()` no longer can be configured with `returnAs` parameter and returns always relative paths (previously returned absolute).
- **(breaking change)** `list()` no longer accepts `useInspect` as a parameter. To achieve old behaviour use `jetpack.list()` with `Array.map()`.
- **(deprecation)** Don't do `jetpack.read('sth', 'buf')`, do `jetpack.read('sth', 'buffer')` instead.
- `remove()`, `list()` and `find()` now can be called without provided `path`, and defaults to CWD in that case.

# 0.7.2 (2016-03-09)
- Fixed .dotfiles copying

# 0.7.1 (2015-12-17)
- Updated third party dependencies.

# 0.7.0 (2015-07-20)
- **(breaking change)** `matching` option in `copy()` and `find()` resolves glob patterns to the folder you want copy or find stuff in (previously CWD was used).

# 0.6.5 (2015-06-19)
- `exists()` can handle ENOTDIR error.

# 0.6.3 and 0.6.4 (2015-04-18)
- Added support for symbolic links.

- Option `matching` in `copy()` and `find()` now accepts patterns anchored to CWD.

# 0.6.1 (2015-04-03)
- Option `matching` in `copy()` and `find()` now accepts negation patterns (e.g. `!some/file.txt`).

# 0.6.0 (2015-03-30)
- Lots of code refactoring
- **(breaking change)** `dir()` no longer has `exists` option.
- **(breaking change)** `file()` no longer has `exists` and `empty` options.
- **(breaking change)** `safe` option for `write()` renamed to `atomic` (and uses new algorithm under the hood).
- **(breaking change)** `safe` option for `read()` dropped (`atomic` while writing is enough).
- **(breaking change)** In `copy()` options `only` and `allBut` have been replaced by option `matching`.
- **(breaking change)** In `remove()` options `only` and `allBut` have been dropped (to do the same use `find()`, and then remove).
- **(breaking change)** Default jsonIndent changed form 0 to 2.
- `find()` method added.
- More telling errors when `read()` failed while parsing JSON.

# 0.5.3 (2015-01-06)
