      "description" : "\nOfficially announcing….\n\nNot Another RPG: The Search for the Chronocruxes!\n\nAlanis has discovered that the Lich Akarot has hidden away his essence in four talismans on a forgotten timeline. With her help, a time-traveling Balnor will guide the Boobs from Moonstone to beyond as they navigate an alternate universe Campaign 1 -- where the corrupting influence of Akarot has prevented Thiala’s reign, but brought about a whole new bag of problems. Play as Hardwon, Moonshine, and Beverly, and level up to use their iconic skillsets and signature moves!\n\nWe’ve partnered with Jo Fu and Conrad Kreyling of Pillow Fight. Jo & Conrad have an incredible ability to combine rich narrative stories with fun, visually compelling gameplay. We’ve also recruited lots of talented artists to help bring the world of Bahumia to life, and can’t wait for you to see their work! \n\nThe game is a blend of turn-based RPGs and classic Adventure games. You’ll solve puzzles as you explore famous Bahumia locales, revisit memorable moments from the show, and meet classic characters — all while experiencing a brand new adventure. The game will be written by Murph, scored by Emily, and art directed by Caldwell! \n\nThe poster was painted by Isabella Gamez, and designed by Caldwell with Lindsay Campbell (who drew this kickass Alanis!). \n\nBe on the lookout for updates on the Patreon as development ramps up!\n\n<3\n\nThe 2 Crew\n\nContinue reading\nNARPG",
